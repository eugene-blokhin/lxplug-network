By default, the plugin scans for wifi networks every 60 seconds, increasing
to every 5 seconds while the menu is open. These times can be overridden
by setting the config parameters "BgScan" and "BgScanMenu", respectively,
in the Config section of the "dhcpcdui" plugin in the lxpanel panel 
definition file. Each takes a time in seconds as an argument - setting
a value to 0 disables the relevant background scan.
